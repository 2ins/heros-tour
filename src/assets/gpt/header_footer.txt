I want a json object with two fields which are: "header" and "footer".

'header' includes the following list of fields:
author name,
the link to the author's web address,
master name,
article link
article summary.
date of experience,
place of experience,
duration of the experience,
the name of the main activity the experience is talked about in the article.

the content of the file you need to generate must be in English.

Now I'll give you the example of the header object.
Please note that this is just an example output and its content needs to be recalculated:

"header": {
"author_name": "Markus Fox",
"author_link": "https://www.youtube.com/@TheStrengthClassroom",
"master_name": "Geshe Lodoe Tsukpi",
"article_link": "https://whatitalkaboutwhenitalkaboutcrystals.wordpress.com/2016/12/30/triten-norbutse-bonpo-monastery",
"summary": "The article details the author's experiences at the Triten Norbutse Bonpo Monastery, exploring practices like Guru Yoga, Dzogchen, and various meditation techniques.",
"date": "December, 2019",
"place": "Kathmandu, Nepal",
"duration": "6 months",
"activity_name": "Buddhist Meditation and Dzogchen Practices"
}

----
footer:


footer will have an "Energies" json object inside it.
"Energies": contains 4 elements that identify the various aspects of the human sphere. corporeal sphere (Body), emotional sentimental sphere (Heart), mental sphere (Mind), sexual sphere (Sexual). for each of these 4 give a value from 0 to 10 to indicate the impact of the experience on the author.
Put 0 if there are no direct references or implications that indicate an impact of the experience on the sexual (Sex), mental (Mind), emotional (Heart), or bodily (Body) sphere of the author.

here is the json example. Please note that this is just an example output:
"footer":{
    "Energies": [
{
"Body": 8,
"Description": "L'esperienza ha portato a un miglioramento significativo della flessibilit√† fisica e del comfort nelle posture di seduta."
},
{
"Heart": 7,
"Description": ""
},
{
"Mind": 9,
"Description": ""
},
{
"Sexual": 0,
"Description": ""
}
]

}
