  <h1 style="text-align: center">Virtues</h1>
  Cultures around the world have valued the study of human strength and virtue.
  Psychologists have a particular interest in it as they work to encourage
  individuals to develop these traits. While all cultures value human virtues,
  different cultures express or act on virtues in different ways based on
  differing societal values and norms. <br />Martin Seligman and his colleagues
  studied all major religions and philosophical traditions and found that the
  same six virtues (i.e. courage, humanity, justice, etc.) were shared in
  virtually all cultures across three millennia. Since these virtues are
  considered too abstract to be studied scientifically, positive psychology
  practitioners focused their attention on the strengths of character created by
  virtues, and created tools for their measurement. <br /><br />
